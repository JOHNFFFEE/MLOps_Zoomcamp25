Welcome to my repository for the DataTalksClub MLOps Zoomcamp. This project encompasses the end-to-end implementation of MLOps principles, covering everything from data ingestion to model deployment and monitoring.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This repository documents my journey through the MLOps Zoomcamp, focusing on:

Data ingestion and preprocessing

Model training and evaluation

Model packaging and deployment

Workflow orchestration with tools like Prefect

Model monitoring and logging

The goal is to build a scalable and maintainable machine learning pipeline using industry-standard MLOps practices.
